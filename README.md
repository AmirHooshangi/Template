Template
========

An Emacs extension for creating project templates (Currently based on [Giter8] )


### Requirements

* Emacs 24.3 or higher, (has been tested on 24.3.1)
* Set up [Giter8]  (SBT, etc)
 
```sh
$ g8 [arguments]   => this command being used by emacs
```

### Installation

TODO

### How to use

All you need is "create-project" command in Emacs which asks you to enter your g8 template name.
for example "typesafehub/scala-sbt", if you're not sure about the first part (here typesafehub) you can search the
scala templates like this "*/scala". and you would get list of available templates in another buffer.


### Free Software ?
hell yeah it's GPL.
